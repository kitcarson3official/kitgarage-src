#+TITLE: Lorenz's attractor

* What is Lorenz's attractor?
To answer this question we must first define what an attractor
is. Matematically, an attractor is a region in space A so that:

\begin{equation}
\exists\ V : A \subset V\ \text{and}\ \forall\ \pmb{x_{0}} \in V \lim_{\pmb{x}\to\infty}
 \varphi(\pmb{x_{0}}, t) = A
\end{equation}

That is to say: if i start in any point int the ragion V of the space i'll
inevitably finish (will be attracted) sooner or later in the region A.
Wait. Who starts where? And why is it being attracted to A?
Well, while a system of equations can be a purely mathematical construct it
often represents a model of some physical, economical or social dynamics.
Edward Lorenz was a mathematician who studied how the weather evolves his state
and extrapolated this system of equations:

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\dot{x} = \sigma(y-x)\\
\dot{y} = \rho x -xz -y\\
\dot{z} = xy - \beta z
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where \[ \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z}\ \text{are the time derivatives of}\ x, y, z\]
